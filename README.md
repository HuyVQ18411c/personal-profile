# Personal Profile
Learning Svelte from scratch.

I create this project to have a general view on how to (really) implement a Svelte project. I like the idea how it handles "state" directly using variables instead of `useState` in ReactJS or `useSignal` in SolidJS. I'm not an Front End expert therefore Svelte really brings a straightforward implementation sense, which is, in my opinion, a big win for me to build something fast.
